        <h1>Trees Growth</h1>
        <p>
          Recent research from 2025 underscores the indispensable role of trees
          as sophisticated "biogenic cooling" systems, highlighting their
          ability to regulate microclimates through transpiration and shade.
        </p>
        <p>
          To put their power into perspective, the cooling effect of a single
          healthy tree is equivalent to the power of two standard air
          conditioning units running for 20 hours a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In densely populated "urban heat islands," where asphalt and concrete
          trap heat, the strategic expansion of tree growth is a primary tool
          for climate resilience; urban canopies have been shown to reduce
          surface temperatures by up to 8°C. This natural refrigeration occurs
          because trees do more than just block sunlight; they actively release
          water vapor into the air, a process that consumes heat energy and
          provides a sustainable, low-energy alternative to mechanical cooling.
